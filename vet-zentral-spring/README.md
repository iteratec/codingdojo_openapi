Shared Backend Service provides APIs to other consumers.

requires JAVA 17 to be available to the gradle build task.

in the console from the root of this project run:
* `.\gradlew bootRunV1` to start this service with V1 support.
* `.\gradlew bootRunV2` to start this service with V2 support.
* `.\gradlew bootRunV1V2` to start this service with V1 & V2 support.

the service will create a file based DB on the first run, thanks to the property `spring.sql.init.mode` in
the `application.properties`. This needs to be disabled when the file based DB is kept between runs - otherwise there
will be an error on start up, where the init db script fails.

The service provides a swagger ui to interact with under: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
